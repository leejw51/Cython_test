 * The optional user-supplied functions Precond and PSolve        *
 * together must define the left preconditoner matrix P           *
 * approximating the system Jacobian matrix                       *
 *    J = dF/dy + cj*dF/dy'                                       *
 * (where the DAE system is F(t,y,y') = 0), and solve the linear  *
 * systems P z = r.   Precond is to do any necessary setup        *
 * operations, and PSolve is to compute the solution of P z = r.  *
 *                                                                *
 * The preconditioner setup function Precond is to evaluate and   *
 * preprocess any Jacobian-related data needed by the             *
 * preconditioner solve function PSolve.  This might include      *
 * forming a crude approximate Jacobian, and performing an LU     *
 * factorization on it.  This function will not be called in      *
 * advance of every call to PSolve, but instead will be called    *
 * only as often as necessary to achieve convergence within the   *
 * Newton iteration in IDA.  If the PSolve function needs no      *
 * preparation, the Precond function can be NULL.                 *
 *                                                                *
 * Each call to the Precond function is preceded by a call to     *
 * the system function res with the same (t,y,y') arguments.      *
 * Thus the Precond function can use any auxiliary data that is   *
 * computed and saved by the res function and made accessible     *
 * to Precond.                                                    *

 * The error weight vector ewt, step size hh, and unit roundoff   *
 * uround are provided to the Precond function for possible use   *
 * in approximating Jacobian data, e.g. by difference quotients.  *
 *                                                                *

 * Thus if this routine calls res a total of W times, it should   *
 * perform the update *nrePtr += W.                               *

 *           preconditioner matrix.  See the description of the   *
 *           type IDASpgmrPSolveFn above.  Pass NULL for psolve   * 
 *           if no preconditioning is to be done.  However, a     *
 *           preconditioner of some form is strongly encouraged.  *
 *                                                                *
 * gstype    is the type of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to be  *
 *           used.  This must be one of the two enumeration       *
 *           constants MODIFIED_GS or CLASSICAL_GS defined in     *
 *           iterativ.h.  These correspond to using modified or   *
 *           classical Gram-Schmidt algorithms, respectively.     *
 *                                                                *
 * maxl      is the maximum Krylov subspace dimension, an         *
 *           optional input.  Pass 0 to use the default value,    *
 *           MIN(Neq, 5).  Otherwise pass a positive integer.     *
 *                                                                *
 * maxrs     is the maximum number of restarts to be used in the  *
 *           GMRES algorithm, an optional input.  maxrs must be a *
 *           non-negative integer, or -1.  Pass 0 to use the      *
 *           default value, which is 5.  Pass -1 to use the       *
 *           value 0, meaning no restarts.  In any case, maxrs    *
 *           will be restricted to the range 0 to Neq/maxl.       *
 *                                                                *
 * eplifac   is a factor in the linear iteration convergence      *
 *           test constant, an optional input.  Pass 0.0 to use   *
 *           the default, which is 1.0.  Otherwise eplifac must   *
 *           be a positive real number.                           *
 *                                                                *
 * dqincfac  is a factor in the increments to yy used in the      *
 *           difference quotient approximations to matrix-vector  *
 *           products Jv, an optional input.  Pass 0.0 to use     *
 *           the default, which is 1.0.  Otherwise dqincfac must  *
 *           be a positive real number.                           *
 *                                                                *
 * pdata     is a pointer to user preconditioner data.  This      *
 *           pointer is passed to precond and psolve every time   *
 *           these routines are called.                           *
 *                                                                *
 * IDASpgmr returns either                                        *
 *    SUCCESS = 0             if successful, or                   *
 *    IDA_SPGMR_FAIL = -1     if either IDA_mem was null or a     *
 *                            malloc failure occurred, or         *
 *    IDA_SPGMR_BAD_ARG = -2  if gstype was found illegal.        *

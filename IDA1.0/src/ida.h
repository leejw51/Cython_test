 *----------------------------------------------------------------*        
 * The F function which defines the DAE system   F(t,y,y')=0      *
 * must have type ResFn.                                          *
 * Symbols are as follows: t  <-> tres     y <-> yy               *
 *                         y' <-> yp       F <-> res (type ResFn) *
 * A ResFn takes as input the problem size Neq, the independent   *
 * variable value tres, the dependent variable vector yy, and the *
 * derivative (with respect to t) of the yy vector, yp.  It       *
 * stores the result of F(t,y,y') in the vector resval.  The      *
 * yy, yp, and resval arguments are of type N_Vector.             *
 * The rdata parameter is to be of the same type as the rdata     *
 * parameter passed by the user to the IDAMalloc routine. This    *
 * user-supplied pointer is passed to the user's res function     *
 * every time it is called, to provide access in res to user data.*
 *                                                                *
 * A ResFn res will return the value ires, which has possible     *
 * values RES_ERROR_RECVR = 1, RES_ERROR_NONRECVR = -1,           *
 * and SUCCESS = 0. The file ida.h may be used to obtain these    *
 * values but is not required; returning 0, +1, or -1 suffices.   *
 * RES_ERROR_NONRECVR will ensure that the program halts.         *
 * RES_ERROR_RECVR should be returned if, say, a yy or other input*
 * value is illegal. IDA will attempt to correct and retry.       *

 * rtol    is a pointer to the relative tolerance scalar.         *

 *         Both rtol and atol are used to compute the error weight*
 *         vector, ewt. The error test required of a correction   *
 *         delta is that the weighted-RMS norm of delta be less   *
 *         than or equal to 1.0. Other convergence tests use the  *
 *         same norm. The weighting vector used in this norm is   *
 *         ewt. The components of ewt are defined by              *
 *         ewt[i] = 1.0/(rtol*yy[i] + atol[i]). Here, yy is the   *
 *         current approximate solution.  See the routine         *
 *         N_VWrmsNorm for the norm used in this error test.      *

 * id      is an N_Vector, required conditionally, which states a *
 *         given element to be either algebraic or differential.  *
 *         A value of 1.0 indicates a differential variable while *
 *         a 0.0 indicates an algebraic variable. 'id' is required*
 *         if optional input SUPPRESSALG is set, or if IDACalcIC  *
 *         is to be called with icopt = CALC_YA_YDP_INIT.         *
 *         Otherwise, 'id' may be NULL.                           *
 *                                                                *
 * constraints  is an N_Vector defining inequality constraints    *
 *         for each component of the solution vector y. If a given*
 *         element of this vector has values +2 or -2, then the   *
 *         corresponding component of y will be constrained to be *
 *         > 0.0 or < 0.0, respectively, while if it is +1 or -1, *
 *         the y component is constrained to be >= 0.0 or <= 0.0, *
 *         respectively. If a component of constraints is 0.0,    *
 *         then no constraint is imposed on the corresponding     *
 *         component of y. The presence of a non-NULL constraints *
 *         vector that is not 0.0 (ZERO) in all components will   *
 *         cause constraint checking to be performed.             *
 *                                                                *
 * errfp   is the file pointer for an error file where all IDA    *
 *            warning and error messages will be written. This    *
 *            parameter can be stdout (standard output), stderr   *
 *            (standard error), a file pointer (corresponding to  *
 *            a user error file opened for writing) returned by   *

 * optIn   is a flag (boole) indicating whether there are any     *
 *            optional inputs from the user in the arrays         *
 *            iopt and iopt.                                      *

 * machEnv is a pointer to a block of machine environment-specific*
 *            information.  You may pass NULL for this argument   *
 *            in a serial computer environment.                   *

 * Note: The tolerance values may be changed in between calls to  *
 *       IDASolve for the same problem. These values refer to     *
 *       (*rtol) and either (*atol), for a scalar absolute        *
 *       tolerance, or the components of atol, for a vector       *

 * Function : IDACalcIC                                           *
 *                                                                *
 *----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * IDACalcIC calculates corrected initial conditions for the DAE  *
 * system for a class of index-one problems of semi-implicit form.*
 * It uses Newton iteration combined with a Linesearch algorithm. *
 * Calling IDACalcIC is optional. It is only necessary when the   *
 * initial conditions do not solve the given system.  I.e., if    *
 * y0 and yp0 are known to satisfy F(t0, y0, yp0) = 0, then       *
 * a call to IDACalcIC is NOT necessary (for index-one problems). *
 *                                                                *
 * A call to IDACalcIC must be preceded by a successful call to   *
 * IDAMalloc, and by a successful call to the linear system       *
 * solver specification routine.  In addition, IDACalcIC assumes  *
 * that the vectors y0, yp0 and (if relevant) id and constraints  *
 * that were passed to IDAMalloc remain unaltered since that call.*
 *                                                                *
 * The call to IDACalcIC should precede the call(s) to IDASolve   *
 * for the given problem.                                         *  
 *                                                                *
 * The arguments to IDACalcIC are as follows.  The first three -- *
 * ida_mem, icopt, tout1 -- are required; the others are optional.*
 * A zero value passed for any optional input specifies that the  *
 * default value is to be used.                                   *
 *                                                                *
 * IDA_mem is the pointer to IDA memory returned by IDAMalloc.    *
 *                                                                *
 * icopt  is the option of IDACalcIC to be used.                  *
 *        icopt = CALC_YA_YDP_INIT   directs IDACalcIC to compute *
 *                the algebraic components of y and differential  *
 *                components of y', given the differential        *
 *                components of y.  This option requires that the *
 *                N_Vector id was input to IDAMalloc, specifying  *
 *                the differential and algebraic components.      *
 *        icopt = CALC_Y_INIT   directs IDACalcIC to compute all  *
 *                components of y, given y'.  id is not required. *
 *                                                                *
 * tout1  is the first value of t at which a soluton will be      *
 *        requested (from IDASolve).  (This is needed here to     *
 *        determine the direction of integration and rough scale  *
 *        in the independent variable t.                          *

 * epicfac is a positive scalar factor in the Newton convergence  *
 *        test.  This test uses a weighted RMS norm (with weights *
 *        defined by the tolerances, as in IDASolve).  For new    *
 *        initial value vectors y and y' to be accepted, the norm *
 *        of J-inverse F(t0,y,y') is required to be less than     *
 *        epicfac*0.33, where J is the system Jacobian.           *
 *        The default is epicfac = .01, specified by passing 0.   *
 *                                                                *
 * maxnh  is the maximum number of values of h allowed in the     *
 *        algorithm for icopt = CALC_YA_YDP_INIT, where h appears *
 *        in the system Jacobian, J = dF/dy + (1/h)dF/dy'.        *
 *        The default is maxnh = 5, specified by passing 0.       *
 *                                                                *
 * maxnj  is the maximum number of values of the approximate      *
 *        Jacobian or preconditioner allowed, when the Newton     *
 *        iterations appear to be slowly converging.              *
 *        The default is maxnj = 4, specified by passing 0.       *
 *                                                                *
 * maxnit is the maximum number of Newton iterations allowed in   *
 *        any one attempt to solve the IC problem.                *
 *        The default is maxnit = 10, specified by passing 0.     *
 *                                                                *
 * lsoff  is an integer flag to turn off the linesearch algorithm *
 *        (lsoff = 1). The default is lsoff = 0 (linesearch done).*
 *                                                                *
 * steptol is a positive lower bound on the norm of a Newton step.*
 *        The default value is steptol = (unit roundoff)^(2/3),   *
 *        specified by passing 0.                                 *

 * IDACalcIC returns an int flag.  Its symbolic values and their  *
 * meanings are as follows.  (The numerical return values are set *
 * above in this file.)  All unsuccessful returns give a negative *
 * return value.  If IFACalcIC failed, y0 and yp0 contain         *
 * (possibly) altered values, computed during the attempt.        *
 *                                                                *

 * Function : IDASolve                                            *
 *----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * IDASolve integrates the DAE over an interval in t, the         *
 * independent variable. If itask is NORMAL, then the solver      *
 * integrates from its current internal t value to a point at or  *
 * beyond tout, then interpolates to t = tout and returns y(tret) *
 * in the user-allocated vector yret. In general, tret = tout.    *
 * If itask is ONE_STEP, then the solver takes one internal step  *
 * of the independent variable and returns in yret the value of y *
 * at the new internal independent variable value. In this case,  *
 * tout is used only during the first call to IDASolve to         *
 * determine the direction of integration and the rough scale of  *
 * the problem. In either case, the independent variable value    *
 * reached by the solver is placed in (*tret). The user is        * 
 * responsible for allocating the memory for this value. There are*
 * two other itask options: NORMAL_TSTOP and ONE_STEP_TSTOP. Each *
 * option acts as described above with the exception that the     *
 * solution does not go past the independent variable value tstop.*
 *                                                                *
 * IDA_mem is the pointer (void) to IDA memory returned by        *
 * IDAMalloc.                                                     *
 *                                                                *
 * tout  is the next independent variable value  at which a       *
 * computed solution is desired                                   *
 *                                                                *
 * tstop is the (optional) independent variable value past which  *
 * the solution is not to proceed (see itask options)             *
 *                                                                *
 * *tret  is the actual independent variable value corresponding  *
 * to the solution vector yret.                                   *
 *                                                                *
 * yret  is the computed solution vector. With no errors,         *
 *            yret=y(tret).                                       *
 *                                                                *
 * ypret is the derivative of the computed solution vector at tret*
 *                                                                *
 * Note: yret and ypret may be the same N_Vectors as y0 and yp0   *
 * in the call to IDAMalloc.                                      *
 *                                                                *
 * itask is NORMAL, NORMAL_TSTOP, ONE_STEP, or ONE_STEP_TSTOP.    *
 *        These modes are described above.                        *
 *                                                                *

 * (The numerical return values are defined above in this file.)  *
 * All unsuccessful returns give a negative return value.         *

 *                 internal stepping. The ILL_INPUT flag          *
 *                 will also be returned if the linear solver     *
 *                 routine IDA--- (called by the user after       *

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------*
 * The purpose of ida_linit is to allocate memory for the          *
 * solver-specific fields in the structure *(idamem->ida_lmem) and *
 * perform any needed initializations of solver-specific memory,   *
 * such as counters/statistics. The ida_linit routine should set   *
 * *setupNonNull to be TRUE if the setup operation for the linear  *
 * solver is non-empty and FALSE if the setup operation does       *
 * nothing. An (*ida_linit) should return LINIT_OK (== 0) if it has*
 * successfully initialized the IDA linear solver and LINIT_ERR    *
 * (== -1) otherwise. These constants are defined above. If an     *
 * error does occur, an appropriate message should be sent to      *
 * (idamem->errfp).                                                *
